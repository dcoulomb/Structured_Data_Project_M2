This is a master project for the class 'Structure Data' hold by Florence d'Alché Buc and Slim Essid.

We worked on the paper written by Hongyu Su, Markus Heinonen and Juho Rousu:
“Structured output prediction of anti-cancer drug activity” (2010)

We tried to implement the methods they present and to comment the results we obtained. 
To do that, the authors shared with us their work and we used a lot of what they did. Thanks a lot to them.
