This is a master project for the class 'Structure Data' hold by Florence d'Alché Buc and Slim Essid.

We worked on the paper written by Hongyu Su, Markus Heinonen and Juho Rousu:
“Structured output prediction of anti-cancer drug activity” (2010)

The goal was implement the methods presented in the paper and to comment the results we obtained.

Here is the github account in reference: hongyusu/Molecular_Classification

The folder /references contains:

Thanks a lot to them.
