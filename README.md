This is a master project for the class 'Structure Data' hold by Florence d'Alché Buc and Slim Essid.

We worked on the paper written by Hongyu Su, Markus Heinonen and Juho Rousu:
“Structured output prediction of anti-cancer drug activity” (2010)

The goal was implement the methods presented in the paper and to comment the results we obtained.

To do that, the authors shared with us their work and we used a lot of what they did:

Here is the github account in reference: hongyusu/Molecular_Classification

The folder /references contains:
• the original matlab code they shared with us
• the paper in reference

Thanks a lot to them.
