# Structured Data

This is a master project for the class **Structure Data** hold by Florence d'Alché Buc and Slim Essid at *M2 Data Siences - Université Paris-Saclay*.

We worked on the following article paper:

Su, H., Heinonen, M., & Rousu, J. (2010, September). Structured output prediction of anti-cancer drug activity. In *IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition in Bioinformatics* (pp. 38-49). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16001-1_4)

The goal was to implement the methods presented in the paper and to comment the results we obtained. 

## References

To do that, the authors shared with us their work and we used a lot of what they did:

Here is the github repository in reference: https://github.com/hongyusu/Molecular_Classification

The folder /references contains:
- the original matlab code they shared with us
- the paper in reference

Thanks a lot to them.
